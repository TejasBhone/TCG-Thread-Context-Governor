## Implementation Note

A runnable backend implementation of Goal Preservation (GP) exists and is used internally for experimentation and validation.

The implementation is not included in this repository. This project focuses on documenting GP’s behavioral contract, boundaries, and observed characteristics rather than providing a reference implementation.

The omission is intentional and reflects a separation between behavior specification and executable systems. Implementation details may vary depending on integration context and are not required to evaluate GP’s design goals.
